## Project Objective

Identifying with a level of certainty the conversion to an opportunity as well as a probability to close by looking for trends in the features captured of the new incoming leads.

### Methods Used

* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter

## Project Description

As a new quarter approaches, an influx of new sales activity has led your sales team to work systematically down a list of new leads. With a limited number of resources and time, being able to quickly identify a lead with a higher probability to convert to an opportunity and ultimately a close would aide in the prioritization and focus of your dedicated sales resources, maximizing their time and effectiveness. We can leverage ML to identify with a level of certainty the conversion to an opportunity as well as a probability to close by looking for trends in the features captured of the new incoming leads. Business Question: Given these attributes of each lead, will it convert to an opportunity? Data Set Structure Guidelines: New incoming leads are structured on each row with lead information. The OppStatus is the target column and will be predicted along with a probability percentage which can then be grouped into probability ranges for consumption.
